title: What's Tor?
----
description:
- Tor is a free software and an open network
- Mitigates against tracking, surveillance and censorship
- Run by a US non-profit and volunteers from all over the world
- It' s Tor, not TOR

title: The Tor network
----
description:
- An open network, everyone can be part of it. Basically, your server will relay the tor traffic to another server in the Internet.
- The network is composed by different types of servers run by volunteers around the world.
- To ingress in the network, the new server will pass automatically to a new relay lifecycle.

title: Why run a Tor relay?
----
description:
By running a Tor relay you can help make the Tor network:
- faster (and therefore more usable
- more robust against attacks
- more stable in case of outages
- safer for its users (spying on more relays is harder than on a few)

title: Guard/middle (aka non-exit) relay
----
description:
- A guard is the first relay in the chain of 3 relays building a Tor circuit.
- A middle relay is neither a guard nor an exit, but acts as the second hop between the two.
- To become a guard, a relay has to be stable and fast (at least 2MByte/s) otherwise it will remain a middle relay.

title: Exit relay
----
description:
- The exit relay is the final relay in a Tor circuit, the one that sends traffic out its destination.
- That's why exit relays have the greatest legal exposure and liability of all the relays.
- Before running an exit relay, check it with your local digital rights organization.
- **You should not run a Tor exit relay from your home**

title: Bridge
----
description:
- A bridge is a node in the network that isn't listed in the public Tor directory, which make it harder for ISPs and governments to block it.
- Bridges are relatively easy, low-risk and low bandwidth Tor nodes to operate.
- And there's another special kind of bridge: Pluggable transports. It hides your tor traffic by adding an additional layer of obfuscation.

title: The lifecycle of a new relay
----
description:
Non-exit relays pass by a lifecycle of four phases (defined by days):
- Days 0-3: the unmeasured phase
- Days 3-8: network authorities start the remote measurement phase (the ramp-up guard phase)
- Days 8-68: guard phase (where load counter intuitively drops and then rises higher)

title: The lifecycle of a new relay
----
description:
- And after 68 days, if the relay is stable and fast enough, it receives a Guard flag (steady-state guard phase).
- Exit relays also have a lifecycle more or less similar.
- Read about all the phases in: [https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-new-relay](https://blog.torproject.org/lifecycle-new-relay)

title: Before we start
----
description:
- Never run a relay without the consent of network administrator or machine owner. Read the Terms of Service (ToS) first, so you donâ€™t lose money.
- Choose which type of relay you will host. Non-exit relay is a easy way to start helping the network.
- Read the documentation: [https://torproject.org/tor-relays](https://torproject.org/tor-relays)

title: Bandwidth requirements
----
description:
- At least 16 Mbit/s (Mbps) upload and download bandwidth available for Tor. More is better.
- The minimum requirements for a relay are 10 Mbit/s (Mbps).
- If you have less than 10 Mbit/s but at least 1 Mbit/s we recommend you run a bridge with obfs4 support.

title: Monthly outbound traffic
----
description:
- It is required to use a minimum of 100 GByte of outbound/incoming traffic per month.
- If you have a metered plan you might want to configure tor to only use a given amount of bandwidth or monthly traffic.
- More (>2 TB/month) is better and recommended

title: Public IPv4 address
----
description:
- Every relay needs a public IPv4 address - either directly on the host (preferred) or via NAT and port forwarding.
- The IPv4 address is not required to be static but static IP addresses are preferred.
- Your IPv4 address should remain unchanged for at least 3 hours (network consensus).
- You can only run two Tor relays per public IPv4.
