title: OONI Explorer Advanced Search
---
subtitle:

This project is about enriching the OONI Explorer search functionality with the ability to visualize an analysis of metadata pertaining to filtered measurements.

---
body:

This would involve adding the ability to filter on multiple axis: country, ASN, time range, anomaly, confirmed, failure, domain or input, citizenlab category code.

The results would then be presented in an aggregate form, such as showing:

- The total measurement count
- The anomaly vs total ratio
- Confirmed vs total
- Failure vs total

These results could then be presented as a table or some other charts, such as a heatmat.

Some other more detailed, drill-down views could also be implemented.

A potential applicant should also have some prior design
