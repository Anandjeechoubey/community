title: OONI Probe network experiments
---
subtitle:

As part of this project you would be working on researching and developing new OONI Probe network experiments.

---
body:

These experiments would be integrated inside of probe-engine and could eventually make their way into the OONI Probe desktop client.

The GSoC project is only about researching and implementing a working test in probe-engine, not the UI and client integration of the test.

For some inspiration on some ideas for new experiments, see: https://github.com/ooni/probe-engine/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+experiment%22
