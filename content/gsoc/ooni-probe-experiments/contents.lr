# Problem

# Proposal

*Prerequisites:* Knowledge of network programming

As part of this project you would be working on researching and developing new OONI Probe network experiments. These experiments would be integrated inside of probe-engine and could eventually make their way into the OONI Probe desktop client.

The GSoC project is only about researching and implementing a working test in probe-engine, not the UI and client integration of the test.
